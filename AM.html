    <h3><center>Personal life and goals</center></h3>
    <p><center>Aside from school, I enjoy reading and writing short stories. I frequently visit family and my best friend to help them throughout the week. I also like to practice driving and cooking with my mom at home.In the future I plan to eventually become sucessful by making my own book website and then I will build a house of my own in Seattle, along with a small business space to give aspiring writers a safe writing space as a second job. My prime occupation will be writing in some regard to a science network.</center></p>
